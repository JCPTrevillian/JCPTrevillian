### Welcome to my GitHub!
<br>
Hello! I'm Jennifer, a Software Engineer who combines technical knowledge with excellent communication skills
to create user-centric web applications. I am passionate about using technology to bridge the gap between users 
and innovative digital solutions. I'm excited to continue my growth by contributing to innovative projects and delivering solutions that make a meaningful impact. With a strong work ethic, a passion for learning, and a collaborative mindset - 
I'm ready to take on new challenges and excel in this dynamic field.<br>

Tech is my ‚ù§Ô∏è  (along with my rescue üêï Max)

  <summary><h4>:book: My Life Changing Journey into Tech (Because everyone loves a great background story!)</h4></summary>
  I was a State of California Registered Dental Assistant who worked my way up through every role in the dental practice from back office clinical roles to front office administrative roles until 
  I served in the top spot as General Manager. I was responsible for multiple locations as General Manager to an oral surgery practice. I also owned and managed an incorporated small business. 
  <br> 
 
  <br> 
 
  During the pandemic I decided to take a leap of faith and bet on myself. While I loved helping others in dentistry, I also love
  building/creating things. I love Data. Data was something I took the initiative to leverage in my 
  Dental roles so I decided to explore Data by completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. That 
  did not satisfy my love for creating/building things so I considered software engineering. I read about the APP partnership
  with Anita B and Intuit and felt that would be such an amazing life-chaging experience so I applied. 
  
  **Imagine my excitement when I learned out of hundreds of applicants I was one of the chosen few!**
  
  During my apprenticeship I worked hard to earn my full stack Tech Degree (Javascript, Node, React, Express, SQL) while forging meaningful 
  friendships with others in my cohort. I was thrilled to be placed on Prediction Service Team (AI/ML) as an Engineer at Intuit. 
  Through this experience I learned best practices during sprints while honing my skills in software development, testing, and end of 
  sprint 
  code presentations/demonstrations. That reinforced my belief in the importance of teamwork, effective communication, and adaptability in 
  a fast-paced development environment.<br> 
  <br>
  *During my software engineering apprenticeship at Intuit, I earned two awards: Customer Obsession and Courage.* 
   
  During my apprenticeship I loved creating user centric web applications, knowing I am helping others. I enjoy design - 
  not merely for aesthetics but for the intentional functionality written into the code working hard behind the scenes. 
  I continue to be fascinated by the power of data and how it can inform and influence positive outcomes.
  I am excited to continue building more things. I am actively learning every day - reinforcing and strengthening my front and back end skills. 
  I can best be described as a naturally curious person who enjoys exploring the things I want to master.
  Those who have worked with me would more than likely share that I genuinely love helping others. 
  
  When I look back at who I was a year ago when I first started to who I am today? I have come a long way. 
  
  I am so excited for where my tech journey leads next!
