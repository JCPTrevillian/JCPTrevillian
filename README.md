  <summary><h4>My Life Changing Journey into Tech  (if you love a great background story!)</h4></summary>
  I was a State of California Registered Dental Assistant who worked my way up through every role in the dental office to General Manager. 
  
  I was responsible for multiple locations for an oral surgery practice. I also owned and operated an incorporated small business. 
  
  
  During the pandemic I decided to take a leap of faith and bet on myself. While I loved helping others in dentristry - I also love
  building/creating things. I love Data. Data was something I took the initiative to leverage in my 
  Dental roles so I decided to explore Data by completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. Unfortunately that 
  did not satisfy my love for creating/building things so I considered software engineering. I heard about the APP partnership
  with Anita B and Intuit and felt that would be such an amazing life-chaging experience so I applied. 
  
  **Imagine my excitement when I learned out of hundreds of applicants I was one of the chosen few!**
  
  The apprenticeship was split into two parts: the intensive learning phase and the apprenticeship phase. In the first half, the learning phase, 
  I worked hard to earn my full stack Tech Degree (Javascript, Node, React, Express, SQL) while forging meaningful friendships with 
  others in my cohort. For the apprenticeship phase I was thrilled to be placed on Prediction Service Team (AI/ML) as a Front End Engineer. 
  Through this experience I learned best practices during sprints while honing my skills in software development, testing, and end of sprint 
  code review presentations/demonstrations. That reinforced the importance of teamwork, effective communication, and adaptability in a fast-paced development environment. 
  *Within my short time with Intuit, I earned two awards: Customer Obsession and Courage.* 
   
  I love creating user centric web applications, knowing I am helping others. I enjoy design - not merely for asthetics but for the intentional 
  functionality written into the code working hard behind the scenes. I am actively learning every day - reinforcing and strengthening my 
  front and back end skills. I can best be described as a naturally curious person who asks questions and likes to explore the things I want to master.
  
  When I look back at who I was a year ago when I first started to who I am today? I have come a long way. 
  
  I am so excited for where my tech journey leads next!
