Hello! I'm Jennifer, a Software Engineer in San Francisco who combines technical knowledge with excellent communication skills
to create user-centric web applications. I am passionate about using technology to bridge the gap between users 
and innovative digital solutions. I'm excited to continue my growth by contributing to innovative projects and delivering solutions that make a meaningful impact. 
With a strong work ethic, a passion for learning, and a collaborative mindset - I'm ready to take on new challenges and excel in this dynamic field.<br>

<summary><h4>:book: My Life Changing Journey into Tech (Because everyone loves a great background story!)</h4></summary>
I transitioned into tech from a successful career in dentistry as a State of California Registered Dental Assistant. Working my way up through various roles in the dental practice, from back office 
clinical positions to front office administrative responsibilities, I eventually achieved the top role as General Manager overseeing multiple locations for an oral surgery practice. Priot to that I managed my own incorporated small business.


During the pandemic, I made a life-changing decision to take a leap of faith and follow my passion for building and creating things. While dentistry had been a fulfilling field where I enjoyed helping 
others, I felt a strong connection with data and its potential applications. Even during my dental career, I proactively used data to enhance my performance in various roles. To explore my passion 
further, I pursued and successfully completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.

However, my desire for creating and building things persisted, leading me to consider software engineering as a potential career path. During my research, I came across the APP partnership with Anita B 
and Intuit, which seemed like an incredible opportunity to combine my passion for technology with my eagerness to make a positive impact. Excitement surged through me when I found out that, out of 
numerous applicants, I was among the chosen few selected for this unique opportunity.

Throughout my software engineering apprenticeship at Intuit, I dedicated myself to learning and growing. I earned my full-stack Tech Degree (Javascript, Node, React, Express, and SQL)
The Prediction Service AI Team embraced me as an Engineering Apprentice. I was thrilled to be a part of the team! During my apprenticeship, I learned the value of applying best practices 
during sprints by refining my skills in software development, testing, and end-of-sprint code presentations. The experience reinforced the importance of teamwork, effective communication, 
and adaptability in a fast-paced development environment.

**During my time at Intuit, I was humbled to receive two awards: Customer Obsession and Courage**

As I immersed myself in software engineering, I found satisfaction in creating user-centric web applications with an understanding how my work could positively impact others. I developed a deep 
appreciation for design, not just for aesthetics but for the intentional functionality it brings to the code behind the scenes. My fascination with the power of data continued to grow as I saw how it can inform and influence positive outcomes.

My tech journey has been one of continuous learning and growth. I actively engage in expanding my skills in both front and back-end, embracing challenges as opportunities to master new concepts. 

Reflecting on my progress from a year ago when I took that leap of faith to the present, I am amazed at how far I've come. I'm enthusiastic about where my tech journey will lead me next and excited 
to keep building and creating meaningful things. Each day, I eagerly learn and develop, driven by the desire to make a difference in the tech industry and contribute to a better future.
