  <summary><h4>My Life Changing Journey into Tech  (for people love a great background story!)</h4></summary>
  I was a Registered Dental Assistant who worked my way up through every role in the dental office to General Manager. 
  
  I was responsible for multiple locations for an oral surgery practice. I also owned and operated my own incorporated small business. 
  
  
  During the pandemic I decided to take a leap of faith and bet on myself. While I loved dentristry (I still do) I also love
  bulding things, breaking them, and rebuilding them to understand how it works. Data was something I leveraged in my Dental roles 
  so I decided to explore Data by completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. After, I joined Codecademy
  to learn SQL and Python. I moved on to HTML and that is when I learned I was one of the chosen few for the Apprenticeship Pathway Program 
  partnership with Anita B and Intuit. 
  
  The apprenticeship was split into two parts: the learning phase and the apprenticeship phase. In the first half, the learning phase, 
  I worked hard to earn my full stack Tech Degree (Javascript, Node, React, Express, SQL) from Treehouse. For the apprenticeship phase 
  I was thrilled to be placed on Prediction Service Team (AI/ML) as a Front End Engineer. Through this experience I learned best practices 
  during sprints while honing my skills in software development, testing, and end of sprint code review presentations/demonstrations. 
  This reinforced the importance of teamwork, effective communication, and adaptability in a fast-paced development environment. 
  Within my short time with Intuit, I earned two awards: Customer Obsession and Courage. 
   
  I love creating user centric web applications, knowing I am helping others. I enjoy design - not merely for asthetics but for the intentional 
  functionality written into the code working hard behind the scenes. I continue self-guided learning every day - reinforcing and strengthening my skills.
  I can best be described as a naturally curious person who asks questions and likes to explore the things I want to master.
  
  When I look back at who I was a year ago when I first started to who I am today? 
  
  I have come a long way.
  
  I am so excited for where my tech journey leads next!
