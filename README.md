### Welcome to my GitHub!

Hello! I'm Jennifer, a Software Engineer in San Francisco. I am passionate about using technology to bridge the gap between users and innovative digital solutions. 
I'm excited to continue my growth by contributing to innovative projects and delivering solutions that make a meaningful impact. 
With a strong work ethic, a passion for learning, and a collaborative mindset - I'm ready to take on new challenges and excel in this dynamic field.<br>

<summary><h4>:book: My Life Changing Journey into Tech (Because everyone loves a great background story!)</h4></summary>
I transitioned into tech from a successful career in dentistry as a State of California Registered Dental Assistant. Working my way up through various roles in the dental practice, from back office clinical positions to front office administrative responsibilities, I eventually achieved the top role as General Manager overseeing multiple locations for an oral surgery practice. Prior to that I 
managed my own incorporated small business. 

<br>While dentistry was a deeply fulfilling field where I enjoyed helping others, I felt a strong connection with data and its potential applications. During my dental career, I proactively used data to enhance my performance in various use cases. To further satisfy my curiosity, I successfully completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.
 
This was when I decided to take a leap of faith, bet on myself, and make the transition into tech. 

During my research, I came across the APP partnership with Anita B and Intuit, which seemed like an incredible opportunity to combine my passion for technology with my eagerness to make a positive impact. I was so excited when I found out that out of hundreds of applicants, I was among the chosen few selected for this unique opportunity!

Throughout my software engineering apprenticeship at Intuit, I dedicated myself to learning and growing. I earned my full-stack Tech Degree (Javascript, React, Node, and SQL)  During my apprenticeship, I learned the value of applying best practices during sprints by refining my skills in software development, testing, and end-of-sprint code presentations. The experience reinforced the importance of my existing leadership experience in teamwork, effective communication, and adaptability in a fast-paced development environment.

During my time at Intuit I was humbled to receive two awards: Customer Obsession and Courage. 

My tech journey has been one of continuous learning and growth. I every day work on expanding my skills in both front and back-end, embracing challenges as opportunities to master new concepts.

Reflecting on my progress from a year ago to today, I am amazed at how far I've come. 

I'm excited about where my tech journey will lead me next!
