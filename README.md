\
**Who am I?**
\
\
*TL/DR: I love building things, problem solving, and collaborating with others on a team.* 
\
\
I am software engineer with valuable experience gained through my software engineering apprenticeship with Intuit and Anita B. 
I bring a unique combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on training coupled with extraordinary professional soft skills from my previous career in Dental Management that sets me apart. 
At Intuit I worked with senior engineer mentors - learning best practices during sprints while honing my skills in software development, testing, and problem-solving. 
This also reinforced the importance of teamwork, effective communication, and adaptability in a fast-paced development environment. 
\
\
I am happy to connect with like-minded professionals. I'm open to discussing new opportunities, collaborating on projects, or engaging in conversations related to emerging tech. 
Feel free to reach out to me!
