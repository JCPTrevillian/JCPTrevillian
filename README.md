\
**Who am I?**
\
\
I am software engineer with valuable experience gained through an apprenticeship with Intuit and Anita B. I bring a unique combination of theoretical knowledge, hands-on training, 
and extraordinary soft skills from my previous career in Dental that sets me apart. During my apprenticeship, I had the opportunity to work closely with senior engineers - 
learning best practices during sprints while honing my skills in software development, testing, and problem-solving. 
\
\
My experience as an apprentice has taught me the importance of teamwork, effective communication, and adaptability in a fast-paced development environment. 
I'm excited to leverage my experience and continue my growth as a software engineer, contributing to innovative projects and delivering solutions that make 
a meaningful impact. 
\
\
With a strong work ethic, a passion for learning, and a collaborative mindset, I'm ready to take on new challenges and excel in this dynamic field.
\
\
I am happy to connect with like-minded professionals. I'm open to discussing new opportunities, collaborating on projects, or engaging in conversations related to emerging tech. 
Feel free to reach out to me!
