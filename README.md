**Who am I?**
\
\
*TL/DR: I love building things, problem solving, and collaborating with others on a team.* 
\
\
I am software engineer with valuable experience gained through my software engineering apprenticeship with Intuit and Anita B. 
I bring a unique combination of technical theoretical knowledge and hands-on development training coupled with extraordinary professional 
soft skills from my previous career in Dental Management that sets me apart. At Intuit I worked with senior engineering mentors, 
learning best practices during sprints while honing my skills in software development, testing, and problem-solving. 
This reinforced the importance of teamwork, effective communication, and adaptability in a fast-paced development environment. 
\
\
I am happy to connect with like-minded professionals to discuss new opportunities, collaborate on projects, or engage in conversations related to emerging tech.

Feel free to reach out to me!
